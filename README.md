# Welcome to Electron-Weather!
**This repository houses a series of introductory-to-intermediate exercises to Git familiar with Electron by manipulating and extending a prebuilt weather app.**

## Summary

An example app for building a native-looking Mac OS X tray app with a popover
using [Electron](http://electron.atom.io).

The app shows the weather for the current location and refreshes every 10
minutes.

Built with the [photon](http://photonkit.com) user interface kit.
Uses the [Dark Sky Forecast API](https://developer.forecast.io) as a data source.

## Prerequisites

- Install Git
- Get familiar with Git commands
- Install a text editor
- Install Node.js

### Install Git

#### macOS
- Mac users, while you probably already have _a_ version of Git on your system, it may be out-of-date.
- Consider installing the latest stable version of Git with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)  
  ```sh
  brew install git
  ```
- If you prefer a GUI, try [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)

#### Windows
- [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) is an easy way to install the Git command line tools on Windows.

#### Linux
- While some Linux distributions come with a version of Git installed, it's often out-of-date. [This guide](https://git-scm.com/download/linux) has recommended commands to install Git with your distribution's preferred package manager.

### Get familiar with Git commands
You'll want to know how to [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) a Git repository, and how to [check out a branch](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout#git-checkout-emgitcheckoutemltbranchgt).

If you need a refresher, consider [exploring our free on-demand training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/).

### Install a text editor

### Install Node.js
> **Q:** Why do we need to install Node.js if Electron includes Node.js?
>
> **A:** While Electron does include its own version of Node.js, what we'll install first includes `npm`, the Node Package Manager. NPM is what powers our dependency installation and build processes.

#### macOS
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (recommended) or [installer package](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - [Treehouse has a Homebrew installation guide](http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/homebrew.html)
  - â€¦and a [Node.js installation guide](http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html)
- Homebrew makes it easier to upgrade Node.js, and doesn't require admin privileges (`sudo`) or manually updating the `$PATH`.

#### Windows
- [Installer package](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
  - [Treehouse has a nice step-by-step guide](http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/windows/node-windows.html)

#### Linux
- Let's leave this up to users, making the assumption that as Linux users they can figure it out :grin:  
  - [Treehouse recommends](http://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/linux/node-linux.html) installing via [Linuxbrew](http://linuxbrew.sh)

## Steps for Getting Started
```
Step One: Fork this repo
Step Two: Clone your forked copy to your Command Line
Step Three: `git checkout electron-setup`
Step Four: Open up the files in your text editor.
Step Five: Follow the instructions in the electron-setup branch README.md
```

## End Product
At the end of all of our exercises, you should have an app that looks similar to this!
